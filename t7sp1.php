She is an author, motivational speaker and is part of Inspiring the future, UK. She qualified as a physiotherapist in 2000 followed by her internship at Indian spinal institute, New Delhi and it was during that period when she realized that a diversified market has to be created for physiotherapist before the supply exceeds the demand consequently that was when she accepted the challenges at Ananda in the Himalayas, the worldâ€™s top destination spa as a spa physiotherapist merging the therapies with actual treatments and creating a differentiation strategy for this sector. She got involved in Ananda Academy, teaching Anatomy and physiology to the spa therapist eventually expanding her creativity coupled with innovation and knowledge to wide areas of hospitality leading her to shape award-winning brands globally including ambitious brands like Chelsea Football Club, South Kensington club, Six senses and Jumeirah Hospitality.
